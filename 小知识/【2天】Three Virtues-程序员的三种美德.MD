# Three Virtues

>According to Larry Wall(1), the original author of the Perl programming language, there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris

Perl语言的发明人Larry Wall说，好的程序员有3种美德： **懒惰、急躁和傲慢**（Laziness, Impatience and hubris）。
>1. Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.

### 懒惰:
是这样一种品质，它使得你花大力气去避免消耗过多的精力。它敦促你写出节省体力的程序，同时别人也能利用它们。为此你会写出完善的文档，以免别人问你太多问题。

>2. Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.

### 急躁:
是这样一种愤怒----当你发现计算机懒洋洋地不给出结果。于是你写出更优秀的代码，能尽快真正的解决问题。至少看上去是这样。
>3. Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about.

### 傲慢:
极度的自信，使你有信心写出（或维护）别人挑不出毛病的程序。
